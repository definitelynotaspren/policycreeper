### Federal Register
The official daily publication for rules, proposed rules, and notices of federal agencies and organizations, as well as executive orders and presidential documents.

### Regulatory Capture
A form of government failure where regulatory agencies are dominated by the industries or interests they are charged with regulating, often leading to policies favoring private over public interests.

### Administrative State
A term used (often critically) to describe the collection of federal agencies and civil servants that implement laws and regulations independent of elected officials.

### Deconstruction of the Administrative State

## Public Dissent & Protest Tactics

### Civil Disobedience
The intentional act of disobeying a law or directive considered unjust, typically done non-violently to draw attention to a cause or issue.

### Direct Action
A form of protest that seeks immediate results through demonstrations, sit-ins, blockades, or occupations rather than appeals to authorities or elected bodies.

### Mutual Aid
A decentralized form of social support in which communities pool resources and services to meet needs collectively, often as an alternative to relying on state institutions.

### Nonviolent Resistance
A strategy for social or political change that rejects the use of physical violence, often involving protests, boycotts, and civil disobedience.

### Soft Surveillance
Subtle monitoring of protest movements, often through digital tracking (e.g., social media analysis or cell tower metadata) rather than visible policing.

### Kettling
A controversial police tactic used during protests where law enforcement encircles a crowd in a confined area, preventing exit. It is often used to control movement, facilitate mass arrests, or disperse protestersâ€”but has been criticized as a human rights violation when applied indiscriminately.

### Hot Wash
A debrief conducted immediately after an action, protest, or emergency event. Participants share what went well, what didnâ€™t, and what can be improved. Often used by both organizers and law enforcement. In activist settings, it helps improve operational safety and community resilience.

### Dilemma Action
A protest technique that puts authorities in a lose-lose situation. Protesters take an action that is either harmless or humorous, forcing a response that either escalates unnecessarily or allows the action to succeedâ€”thus exposing authoritarian tendencies or incompetence. Example: giving flowers to riot police or dancing in banned zones.

### Laughtivism
The use of humor, satire, memes, or absurdity to undermine authoritarianism, deflate propaganda, and rally public support. By mocking power structures, laughtivism removes fear and can spread rapidly across digital and real-world platforms. Related to psychological tactics in nonviolent resistance.

### Nonviolent Communication (NVC)
A communication method developed by Marshall Rosenberg designed to de-escalate conflict and foster empathy. Core components include observations, feelings, needs, and requests. Widely used in community organizing and protest contexts to resolve internal disagreements and approach external negotiations with integrity.

## Risk & Response

### Institutional Collapse
The failure or dismantling of a government agency or department, leading to loss of public services and legal oversight, often followed by privatization or executive consolidation.

### Secondary Harm
The indirect consequences of a policy decision (e.g., increased childcare costs after dissolving the Department of Education).

### Legal Retaliation
The use of legal means (e.g., criminal charges, lawsuits, or asset seizure) to punish or intimidate individuals, organizations, or companies perceived as adversarial to government interests.

### Blacklisting
A form of exclusion where individuals or groups are barred from employment, contracts, or government access based on political stance or affiliation.

## Real Estate & Political Power

### Real Estate Lobby
A collective term for developers, agents, brokers, and associated interests that exert political influence, often to preserve tax breaks, resist tenant protections, or promote deregulation.

### Political Capture via Real Estate
The process by which individuals in the real estate industry gain political power or policy influence through campaign donations, appointments, or shadow lobbying.

### Public-Private Partnership (PPP)
A collaborative agreement between government and private sector entities. Can be used for infrastructure development, but also scrutinized for enabling privatization of public services.

## International Oversight

### Interpol
The International Criminal Police Organization, often used for international cooperation on criminal matters but not a court of law.

### NATO
The North Atlantic Treaty Organization, a military alliance. Relevant when monitoring shifts in foreign policy or military posture of the U.S.

### WHO (World Health Organization)
A specialized agency of the United Nations responsible for international public health. U.S. participation has been politicized and is a focus in debates about sovereignty and global governance.
